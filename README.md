## Movie Facts Visualization

We are interested in exploring cinema with Data Visualization. As a visual medium, film itself is already aesthetically rich in content, but it leaves too few clues to interpret itself, too little information for the audience to see the whole picture, to understand the stories or statistics behind and beyond the scenes. We believe data visualization techniques can be used to extract industry-wise meaningful patterns, and compare countless pictures in a new light. We aspire to transcend graphic visuals for cinematic insights with visualizations of movie data.![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/78892787/156454065-55dcc11a-48f8-4d36-9689-b5527335600e.png)
